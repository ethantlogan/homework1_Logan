my name is Ethan Logan and the current date is January 30th, 2025. A little bit about me is I am from Indianapolis, IN and am a current freshman at Madison. I am very excited to go to scschool here and love the environment here, especially the lake. A have a lot of hobbies, but most of them involve the outdoors as I love being outside, such as rock climbing, backpacking, running, and whitewater kayaking. I also love to play piano, listen to music, read, and draw. I really want to be involved with conservation and the environment and wish to protect it. My goal as a wildlife ecologist is protect endangered species and keep the ecosystems intact in our world. I want to do either field work or research after I graduate. I also am interested in the guiding business like seasonal work as a rock climbing guide or kayaking guide. I wish to make some sort of mark on the world however and change it for the better. This class is my first time coding, and I am very excited but also nervous. I'm looking forward to this semester!
